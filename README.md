# What is this repository

This repository contains various notes about various subject I find interesting. I'm a full-stack web developper so it's mainly about the Web, programming devops and similar stuff, but you might find completly unrelated things I just happen to like. **Those notes are mostly written for future me, so you might not understand everything.**

When I'm looking for a solution like, say, a log manager, I will search and try different tools (ELK, Splunk, Loki + Grafana). Then I will write a comparison of those tools in this repo, highlighting the differences, limits and disavantages of each alternative.
